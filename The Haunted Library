# The Haunted Library

## Problem Statement
A group of adventurers has entered a haunted library where books are arranged in a row. Each book has a certain magical power level. The library is cursed: if you take too many powerful books together, the curse activates!  

The adventurers must pick the longest subarray of books where the sum of their powers does not exceed a given limit.
