# The Treasure Hunt

## Problem Statement
You’re on a deserted island with an ancient treasure map. The map is represented by a grid of integers where each cell contains a certain number of gold coins. However, some cells are cursed, and stepping on them ends the hunt.  

Your goal is to find the maximum number of coins you can collect starting from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, moving only **right** or **down**.
